# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Via use of machine learning and neural networks, use the featueres in the dataset to create a binary classifer that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.  This will be accomplished by preprocessing data for a neural network model, compiling, training, and evaluating the model, and optimizing the model.

## Results of Analysis

### Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target for the model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features of the model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation function were selected for the neural network model and why?
- Were the model able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps were taken to try to increase model performance?
